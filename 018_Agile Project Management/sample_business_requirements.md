# Title

## Executive Summary

*Your executive summary should be pretty brief, under 3 paragraphs and should provide a concise summary of the purpose and contents of the rest of the document.  Explain to the reader what they will get from this document.*
Build a project outline for a student connection application which allows students to work and communicate on projects. Should include a search function that allows students to find and filter categorically and specific projects, as well as suggestions for those without a specific goal in mind. Including a discussion forum and personal messaging system.

## Business Objectives

*Business objectives should offer the details for why the project is important.  Outline the goals of the project int he sense of the value it will bring and set expectations.  Keep your objectives measurable to avoid confusion in whether or not they have been met.*
Should achieve an easy to use project/work allocation interface for students to use. Students can find other students that have similar interests for project related work. Will list projects as well as positions needed. Will provide a project creation page as well as a finish function that removes finished projects from list of currently available ones. Include forum/personal messaging system.

## Background

*Provide any relevant background information regarding why this project is being initiated*
Providing students a simple and direct way to search for projects and teammates.

## Scope

*The Scope section should outline what is and is not included as part of this project.  Oftentimes we make assumptions of features or functionality that is not necessarily required.  This is especially useful in a phased approach or when working on an existing system.*
Create a platform that students can use to find projects and teammates. Provide a filter for projects and teammates using tags. Show ongoing projects, but allow filter for finished as well. Each project page should include details on what positions are needed/available, a summary, and an area of expertise.

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*
Since the project search will be using a simple updating library 1 week for making the search feature and page design, 2 weeks for the communication system. 3 weeks total estimated.

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
Low risk. No crucial information about users or their security should be involved.
